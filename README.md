LIFX-Control
============

This is a test project to control LIFX V1 lightbulbs with a C# library.  

Not associated with LIFX, using packet information documented by https://github.com/magicmonkey/lifxjs 

(Huge thanks to MagicMonkey and the others for digging out the protocol, without them none of this would be possible.)

This library is a work in progress - intended features are:

Simple control of bulbs in groups or individually.
Management of exposed bulb properties, including groups and labels.
Scheduled and timed tasks and sequences.
Storage and management of sequences.
Integration with varied sensors.
Support for Win32 apps, WinRT (Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8), and .Net Micro Frameworks.
Example programs for each.
